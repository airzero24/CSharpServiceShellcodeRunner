# CSharpServiceShellcodeRunner
Windows Service assembly to inject Shellcode into local process without using RWX permissions. Posting here so I don't lose the code.

Original code base from a @subTee PoC that I can't find a link for. Also borrowed code from @djhohnstein to avoid RWX permissions. https://github.com/djhohnstein/CSharpCreateThreadExample
